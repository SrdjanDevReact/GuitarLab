# GuitarLab
 GuitarLab is a tool for exploring guitar scales and chords. Scale degrees are visually highlighted with colors, making it easy to understand their relationships. Chord positions are displayed across the entire fretboard, helping you see different voicings and connections. Perfect for learning, improvisation, and composition!
